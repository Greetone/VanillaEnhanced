# VanillaEnhanced

This mod adds a few things to enhance the Vanilla experience.  
*Still in development*

## V6.0 only, there is no backwards compatibility for older versions

This is not because i'm lazy, but because of the major changes of V6.

**Content:**

- Thorium and Surge Alloy Conveyors, Titanium Bridge Conveyor
- A larger Battery
- Titanium Drill (can mine every ore, but is slow)
- Upgraded Force & Overdrive Projectors
- Large Mass Driver
- An Arc turret, but for air defense (currently busted, shoots missiles for now)

> **Made by HolyHades and v1nce.**
